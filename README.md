# Java Notes:
## Servlets:
- The name of a servlet is s different from the servlet class. A servlet class can have multiple names and different urls. Imagine having a servlet class that implement the same logic for two different servlets that conntect to two different databases. Basically one servlet class can map to multiple servlet names and urls.
- To configure a project to run on a local container like tomcat, right click tomcat on Servers in the bottom in eclipse (I know this is bad) and click on add/remove.
- **Context params** get defined in the deployment descriptor `web.xml` and one can get them with
```java
ServletContext s = HttpServlet.getServletContext();
```
- Within The deployment descriptor, we use the `<context-param>` as in:
```xml
<context-param>
	<param-name>database</param-name>
	<param-value>msql</param-value>
</context-param>
```
- `<context-param>` should be listed under the `web-app` tag. Context params are app-wide. For specific servlets, **init params** are used.
- `@MultipartConfig` annotation is used to control file upload. In a file descriptor, `<multipart-config>` tag can be put in a `<servlet>` tag to do the same job.

## JSP:
- **JSPs** combine java code, html tags, built-in jsp tags, custom jsp tags and expression language. They are used to create dynamic html pages.
- JSPs are fancy servlets. They are compiled into java code.
- JSPs have a variety of components including:
	1. **Directives:** controls how JSPs are interpreted and used as in `<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8"%>`. They are also used for importing classes and various other actions that control how a page is used.
	2. **Declarations:** Used to define classes, instance variables, methods.. etc. All these data are limited by the scope of the servlet generated by the JSP. 
	3. **Scriptlets:** Similar to declarations somehow but might have a larger scope than a declaration. A variable defined in a declaration can be used in a Scriptlet but not vice-versa. you can do a lot of actions in a scriptlet like conditionals, loops.. etc. 
	4. **Expressions:** contain java code that return something to the output (e.g. for client display).
- The following are tags used to declare each of the four JSP components:
```jsp
<%@ directive %>
<%! declaration %>
<% scriptlet %>
<%= expression %>
```
- **Comments** take different forms in JSP's. There HTML/XML comments, java comments and JSP comments. HTML comments prevent the browser from showing the commented parts, but JSP code within such comments is still interpreted and the HTML source contains that. Ignoring this might cause security issues (I think). Within JSP tags, java code is commented as usual! JSP comments as a little similar to HMTL comments as in:
```jsp
<%-- JSP comment --%>
```
JSP comments are remove jsp blocks all together. They are neither compiled to java nor sent to the browser.
- **Imports** are done in different similarly to java code in two slightly differnt ways within directives:
```jsp
<%-- You can have imports seperated by commas or have different imports within separate directives -->
<%@ page .... import="java.something.Something, java. something.SomethingElse" %>
<%@ page import="java.something.Something>%
<%@ page import="java.something.SomethingElse>%
<%@ page import="java.something.YetSomethingElse>%
```
- **Directives** are used to perform 3 tasks:
	1. **Change page** properties such as importing new classes, configuring sessions ..etc. 
	2. Directives can also **include JSPs** in other JSPs. This can be done this way:
```jsp
<%@ include file="/path/file.jsp" %>
```
	This is a static include at compile time. It is fast but less dynamic. A more dynamic, albeit slower, follows this pattern:
```jsp
<jsp:include page="/path/index.jsp">
```
	3. They are also used to **include tag libraries**.
